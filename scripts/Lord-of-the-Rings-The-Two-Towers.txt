                           [TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]



                         [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains 
                         as voices drift in from the background.]
 
                         
                                     GANDALF
                         You cannot pass!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder 
                         of the Flame of Anor!
 
                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain 
                         side.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark 
                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of UdÃ»n! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-dÃ»m. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the BalrogÂs sword.] 
                         YOUÂ SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around GandalfÂs ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh!

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains 
                         him.]
 
                                     BOROMIR
                         No! No!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         Fly, you fools!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into 
                         the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
 
                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and 
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     SAM
                         What is it, Mr. Frodo?

                                     FRODO
                         Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
 
                         
                         [Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky 
                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we donÂt want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place weÂre trying to get to. 
                         ItÂs just where we canÂt get. LetÂs 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, weÂre lost. I donÂt 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.
 
                                     FRODO
                         He didnÂt mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo? ItÂs the Ring, isnÂt it?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         ItÂs getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         What food have we got left?

                                     SAM
                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely Â Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
                         but this Elvish stuff, itÂs not bad.
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, 
                         does it Sam?
 
                         [Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously 
                         towards Mordor.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Those rain clouds might.

                         [They continue trekking through difficult 
                         terrain, often huddling underneath their 
                         cloaks.]
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks around] This looks strangely 
                         familiar.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Exasperated] ItÂs because weÂve been 
                         here before! WeÂre going in circles.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant 
                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         WeÂre not alone.
 
                                     [NIGHTTIME
                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         The thieves! The thieves! The filthy 
                         little thieves! Where is it? Where isss 
                         it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. 
                         [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse 
                         them! We hates them! ItÂs ours, it is... 
                         and we wantssss it!
 
                         [Gollum reaches out his hand towards 
                         the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring 
                         up, grab hold of GollumÂs arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. GollumÂs cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around SamÂs neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. YouÂve seen 
                         it before, havenÂt you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or IÂll cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         ItÂs hopeless! Every Orc in MordorÂs 
                         going to hear this racket! LetÂs just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     SAM
                         ItÂs no more than you deserve!

                                     FRODO

                         I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if 
                         it stood but a little higher from the 
                         ground.

                         I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This 
                         is Gimli, son of GlÃ³in and Legolas of 
                         the Woodland realm. We are friends of 
                         Rohan and of ThÃ©oden, your king.

                         from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even 
                         his own kin.

                         Saruman has poisoned the mind of the 
                         king and claimed lordship over these 
                         lands. My company are those loyal to 
                         Rohan. And for that, we are banished. 
                         The White Wizard is cunning. He walks 
                         here and there, they say, as an old 
                         man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere 
                         his spies slip past our nets.

                         We are not spies. We track a party of 
                         Uruk-hai westward across the plain. 
                         TheyÂve taken two of our friends captive.

                         them during the night.

                         But there were two hobbits. Did you 
                         see two hobbits with them?

                         to your eyes.

                         We left none alive. We piled the carcasses 
                         and burned them. [Points to a smoking 
                         pile in the distance.]

                         May these horses bear you to better 
                         fortune than their former masters. Farewell.

                         starts to shift through the smoldering 
                         pile, and pulls out a charred belt and

                         of thrashing hooves bearing down on

                         [Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach 
                         the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor

                         a wide berth between him and Sam.]

                         know it. They go round for miles and 
                         miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick

                         falls face-down into the water.]

                         robes and hair flowing about their gruesome 
                         faces. Their hands are reaching for

                         cry, the Balrog falls from the peak

                         into view.]

                         Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
                         There dwells ThÃ©oden, King of Rohan, 
                         whose mind is overthrown. SarumanÂs 
                         hold over King ThÃ©oden is now very strong.
 
                         
                         [In the Hall, Ãowyn is kneeling before

                         My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? 
                         Uncle?
 
                         [ThÃ©oden just sits and stares ahead, 
                         his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
 
                                     ÃOWYN
                         Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] 
                         Will you do nothing?

                         Be careful what you say. Do not look 
                         for welcome here.
 
                         [They ride on towards Edoras.]



                         [At Edoras, Ãowyn is weeping at the 
                         dead ThÃ©odred's bed. She kisses his 
                         hand. GrÃ­ma appears at the door.]

                         Oh, heÂ he must have died sometime in 
                         the night. What a tragedy for the king 
                         to lose his only son and heir.
 
                         [He sits on the bed and puts a hand 
                         on ÃowynÂs shoulder.]
 
                                     GRÃMA
                         I understand his passing is hard to 
                         accept, especially now that your brother 
                         has deserted you.

                         to Ãowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who 
                         knows what you have spoken to the darkness. 
                         In bitter watches of the night, when 
                         all your life seems to shrink, the walls 
                         of your bower closing in about you, 
                         like a hutch to trammel some wild thing 
                         in.
 
                         [He puts a hand on her cheek and moves 
                         down to her throat.]

                         So fair, so cold, like a morning of 
                         pale spring still clinging to winter's 
                         chill.
 
                         [Ãowyn and GrÃ­ma stare at each other 
                         intently.]

                         [Ãowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, 
                         she looks away into the distance. A 
                         flag comes off its pole and is carried 
                         by the breeze. Ãowyn sees riders coming 
                         towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the 
                         entrance to Edoras, the flag floats 
                         down to land near him. Edoras is silent 
                         and somber. Everyone is dressed in black 
                         and staring at the newcomers in wary 
                         silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall 
                         and sees a lady in white standing on 
                         the steps. He looks around at more somber 
                         people.]

                         [Aragorn looks up to the hall again 
                         but the lady has disappeared. The company 
                         climbs up the stairs to the hall and 
                         is met by guards.]

                         I cannot allow you before ThÃ©oden-King 
                         so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order 
                         of GrÃ­ma Wormtongue.
 
                         [Gandalf nods in understanding and signals 
                         for the others to surrender their weapons. 
                         Aragon hands over his sword and knives. 
                         Legolas gives a little twirl to his 
                         knives before handing them over to the 
                         guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]

                         Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You 
                         would not part an old man from his walking

                         gestures that they follow him into the 
                         hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink 
                         and enters the hall, leaning on LegolasÂ 
                         arm.]

                         My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. 
                         HeÂs a herald of woe.

                         The courtesy of your hall is somewhat 
                         lessened of late, ThÃ©oden King.

                         Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey 
                         the hall and its hostile occupants. 
                         A group of men starts to follow their 
                         steps with hostility.]

                         A just question, my liege. [He walks 
                         towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in 
                         which this conjurer chooses to appear.

                         Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind 
                         you teeth. I have not passed through

                         His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf 
                         while addressing the guards] I told 
                         you to take the wizardÂs staff!

                         Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight 
                         as Gandalf continues to approach ThÃ©oden. 
                         Gamling tries to go forward but HÃ¡ma 
                         holds him back.]

                         but Gimli catches him and pins him to 
                         the floor.]

                         he used to manipulate ThÃ©oden. He lands

                         of a much younger-looking man. Clarity

                         ahead!
 
                                     FRODO
                         Why do you do that?

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     FRODO
                         Call him names; run him down all the 
                         time.
 
                                     SAM
                         BecauseÂ because that's what he is, 
                         Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im 
                         but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he 
                         wants. It's all he cares about.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what 
                         it did to him. What itÂs still doing 
                         to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] 
                         I want to help him, Sam...
 
                                     SAM
                         Why?

                                     FRODO
                         Because I have to believe he can come 
                         back.
 
                                     SAM
                         You canÂt save him, Mr. Frodo.

                                     FRODO
                         [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about 
                         it? Nothing!
 
                         [Sam walks away slowly.]

                                     FRODO
                         [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't 
                         know why I said that.
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his 
                         eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't 
                         take your eyes off it. I've seen you. 
                         You're not eating. You barely sleep. 
                         It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. 
                         You have to fight it!
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Grows angry again] I know what I have 
                         to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to 
                         me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He 
                         walks away]
 
                                     SAM
                         CanÂt you hear yourself? DonÂt you know 
                         who you sound like?
 
                         [Frodo continues to walk away without 
                         looking back.]

                         Yes, precious. False. They will cheat 
                         you, hurt you, lie.

                         me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It 
                         was me. We survived because of me!

                         he goes, preciousss. [He hops around 
                         in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, 
                         gone, gone! SmÃ©agol is free!

                         and dances around. He then picks up 
                         one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's

                         like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]

                         turns to join ThÃ©oden. Ãowyn departs

                         and joins in the fray with Gimli behind

                         off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling

                         is knocked off Hasufel and attacked 
                         by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the 
                         warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt 
                         and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while 
                         the latter is half-dragged by the warg. 
                         In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off 
                         and he rips the Evenstar pendant from 
                         AragornÂs neck as he falls. Aragorn

                         himself and is dragged closer and closer 
                         to the edge of a cliff at great speed.

                         they both disappear over the edge. The 
                         battle is winding down as the Rohirrim

                         HelmÂs Deep has one weakness. Its outer 
                         wall is solid rock but for a small culvert 
                         at its base which is little more than 
                         a drain.

                         Orthanc. Saruman is pouring some dark 
                         dry substances into a vessel. GrÃ­ma 
                         is holding a lit candle in his hand.]

                         How? How can fire undo stone? What kind 
                         of device could bring down the wall?

                         takes hold of GrÃ­maÂs hand and pushes 
                         the candle away from the vessel firmly.]

                         If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep 
                         will fall.

                         it would take a number beyond reckoning, 
                         thousands to storm the keep.

                         But, my lord, there is no such force.

                         candle aloft as he gapes at the vast 
                         army below. A horn is sounded, announcing 
                         the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer 
                         is heard from the army. Saruman raises 
                         a hand.]

                         fight will come to men on both fronts. 
                         Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us 
                         soon. And he will strike hard. He knows 
                         now we do not have the strength to repel 
                         him.
 
                         [The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds 
                         taken off them by Damrod and another 
                         ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves 
                         in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod 
                         sitting behind them on a rock constantly 
                         watching them. Faramir comes up to them 
                         and sits.].
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Well if youÂre not spies, then who are 
                         you?
 
                         [Frodo and Sam remain silent.]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Speak.

                                     FRODO
                         We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins 
                         is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         Your bodyguard?

                                     SAM
                         His gardener.

                                     FARAMIR
                         And where is your skulking friend? That 
                         gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured 
                         look.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [The merest hesitation.] There was no 
                         other.
 
                         [Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         We set out from Rivendell with seven 
                         companions. One we lost in MÃ³ria. Two 
                         were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, 
                         and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son 
                         of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Intently] YouÂre a friend of Boromir?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Yes... for my part.

                                     FARAMIR
                         It will grieve you then to learn that 
                         he is dead.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Shocked] Dead? How? When?

                                     FARAMIR
                         As one of his companions, IÂd hoped 
                         you would tell me. [Pause] He was my 
                         brother.
 


                         [Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. 
                         Suddenly someone comes up to him.]
 
                         
                                     GONDORIAN RANGER
                         Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found 
                         the third one.
 
                         [Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens 
                         as Faramir stands before him.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         You must come with me. Now.

                         [Frodo gets up and follow. They come 
                         to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking 
                         the Forbidden Pool.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Pointing down] Down there.

                         [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving 
                         into the water.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         To enter the forbidden pool bears the 
                         penalty of death. [He gestures to archers 
                         hidden in the bushes.] They wait for 
                         my command.
 
                         [The Rangers notch their arrows]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Shall I shoot?

                         [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges 
                         from the pool onto a rock. He holds 
                         a fish in his hand and starts singing, 
                         slapping the fish on the rock as he 
                         goes.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [singing] The rock and pool is nice 
                         and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish 
                         [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch 
                         a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The 
                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp 
                         and he whacks it some more.]
 
                         [Faramir has his hand raised to order 
                         his men to shoot. At the last moment, 
                         Frodo calls out.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature 
                         is bound to me. And I to him. He is 
                         our guide. Please, let me go down to 
                         him.
 
                         [Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the 
                         Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum 
                         who is gorging on the raw fish.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         SmÃ©agol. [Gollum turns round at FrodoÂs 
                         voice.] Master is here. Come, SmÃ©agol. 
                         Trust master. Come!
 
                         [Frodo gestures for Gollum to follow 
                         him.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We must go now?

                                     FRODO
                         SmÃ©agol, you must trust master. Follow 
                         me, come on. Come. Come, SmÃ©agol. Nice 
                         SmÃ©agol. ThatÂs it. Come on.
 
                         [With the fish between his teeth, Gollum 
                         follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks 
                         up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         DonÂt hurt him! SmÃ©agol donÂt struggle! 
                         SmÃ©agol listen to me!

                         [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's 
                         head. Frodo stares after them with a 
                         stricken expression as Faramir leads 
                         Gollum and his men away. Back in the 
                         cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground. 
                         Crying, he crawls into a corner and 
                         curls up into ball.]
 
                                     GOLLUM

                         trickst us.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Of course he did. I told you he was 
                         tricksy. I told you he was false.
 
                         
                                     SMÃAGOL

                         No, not its business. Leave us alone!

                         little hobbitses. They stole it from 
                         us.

                         [Back in their holding area, Sam and

                         We have to get out of here. You go. 
                         Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, 
                         Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. 
                         Disappear.
 
                                     FRODO
                         I canÂt. You were right, Sam. You tried 
                         to tell me, butÂ IÂm sorry. The RingÂs 
                         taking me Sam. If I put it on, heÂll 
                         find me. HeÂll see.
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo...

                         [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is 
                         the answer to all the riddles. Here 
                         in the wild I have you. Two halflings 
                         and a host of men at my call. The Ring 
                         of power within my grasp.
 
                         [Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's 
                         neck with the tip of his sword.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
                         to show his quality.
 
                         [Frodo is backed up fearfully against 
                         the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo 
                         falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs 
                         the Ring in his hand and jerks himself 
                         away.]

                         No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

                                     SAM
                         Stop it! Leave him alone! DonÂt you 
                         understand? HeÂs got to destroy it. 
                         ThatÂs where weÂre going. Into Mordor. 
                         To the mountain of fire.
 
                         [Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then 
                         Damrod enters.]

                         for reinforcements.
 
                                     SAM
                         Please. ItÂs such a burden. Will you 
                         not help him?
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Captain?

                         Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to 
                         Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
 
                         [Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



                         [Aragorn is riding towards HelmÂs Deep. 
                         On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai 
                         army marching with great speed. He quickly 
                         makes haste towards HelmÂs Deep and 
                         soon sees the refuge.]

                         my friend)

                         of all.]

                         [Pushing his way through the crowd.] 
                         Where is he? Where is he? Get out of 
                         the way. IÂm gonna kill him! [He sees 
                         Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the 
                         canniest and the most reckless man I 
                         ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless 
                         you, laddie!

                         [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn 
                         makes his way in, he runs into Legolas 
                         who stands waiting.]

                         Legolas pauses and looks at AragornÂs 
                         wounds.] You look terrible.
 
                         [To the side, Ãowyn sees Aragorn and 
                         smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas 
                         takes AragornÂs hand and gives the Evenstar 
                         pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar 
                         and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]

                         Ten thousand strong at least.

                         It is an army bred for a single purpose: 
                         to destroy the world of men. They will 
                         be here by nightfall.

                         battle by nightfall.
 
                         [Gamling nods and goes off. ThÃ©oden 
                         stands at the gate of HelmÂs Deep, speaking 
                         to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]

                         We will cover the causeway and the gate 
                         from above. No army has ever breached 
                         the Deeping Wall or set foot inside 
                         the Hornburg.

                         This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
                         These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick 
                         and their shields broad.

                         I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. 
                         I know how to defend my own keep.
 
                         
                         [Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a 
                         hand on GimliÂs shoulder as he follows 
                         Aragorn and ThÃ©oden back in.]

                         They will break upon this fortress like 
                         water on rock. SarumanÂs hordes will 
                         pillage and burn, weÂve seen it before. 
                         Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. 
                         Within these walls, we will outlast 
                         them.

                         They do not come to destroy RohanÂs 
                         crops or villages. They come to destroy 
                         its people. Down to the last child.

                         you have me do? Look at my men. Their 
                         courage hangs by a thread. If this is 
                         to be our end, then I would have them 
                         make such an end as to be worthy of 
                         remembrance.

                         Send out riders, my lord. You must call 
                         for aid.

                         are not so lucky in our friends as you. 
                         The old alliances are dead.

                         Gondor will answer.

                         Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold 
                         fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies 
                         closed in around us? Where was GonÂ

                         time. But now something is about to 
                         happen that has not happened for an

                         hear movement from the forest around

                         boy. Another stares at the axe that 
                         he is handed with frightened eyes. Another 
                         child wearing oversized chain mail takes 
                         up a huge shield. ThÃ©oden stands inside 
                         the main hall of the keep, his back 
                         to the entrance where a bright white 
                         light is streaming through.]

                         To whatever endÂ Where is the horse 
                         and the rider? Where is the horn that 
                         was blowing? They have passed like rain 
                         on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. 
                         The days have gone down in the west. 
                         Behind the hills, into shadow. How did 
                         it come to this?
 


                         [Everyone is getting ready for war at 
                         the battlements. Aragorn is sitting 
                         on the steps. He sees a young lad in 
                         armour holding a sword looking around 
                         nervously.]

                         Haleth, son of HÃ¡ma, my lord. The men 
                         are saying that we will not live out 
                         the night. They say that it is hopeless..
 
                         
                         [Aragorn gives the battered sword a 
                         few swings.]

                         This is a good sword, Haleth, son of 
                         HÃ¡ma.

                         leans close to him, putting a hand on

                         battle gear. His sword is handed to 
                         him as he reaches for it. He nods and 
                         accepts the sword from Legolas.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         We have trusted you this far. You have 
                         not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
                         wrong to despair.

                         to forgive, Legolas.)
 
                         [They smile and clap one another on 
                         the shoulders. They look at Gimli as 
                         he walks up to them, struggling with 
                         his chain mail.]

                         lands with its length right to the floor.]

                         That is no Orc horn. [They run out to 
                         the battlements.]

                         I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. 
                         An alliance once existed between Elves 
                         and men. Long ago we fought and died 
                         together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, 
                         and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.

                         sounds of a marching army move closer 
                         and closer. The women and children in 
                         the caves hear the sounds overhead and 
                         are frightened. Mothers draw their children 
                         close and try to sooth crying babies.

                         continues to march at the fortress,

                         climbing over the wall, whacking it 
                         in the groin with his axe and killing

                         and stand on a ledge just to the side 
                         of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over, 
                         seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming 
                         the gate.]

                         What?

                         I cannot jump the distance! YouÂll have 
                         to toss me!

                         to grab the Dwarf.]

                         I will leave you at the western borders 
                         of the forest. You can make your way

                         Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can 
                         slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer 
                         we are to danger, the farther we are 
                         from harm. ItÂs the last thing heÂll

                         But then, you are very small. Perhaps 
                         youÂre right. South it is then. Hold 
                         on, little Shirelings. I always like 
                         going south. Somehow it feels like going 
                         down hill.

                         That meant something, even if you were 
                         too small to understand why. But I think, 
                         Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
                         Folk in those stories had lots of chances 
                         of turning back only they didnÂt. They 
                         kept going because they were holding 
                         on to something.
 
                                     FRODO
                         What are we holding on to, Sam?

                                     SAM
                         ThereÂs some good in this world, Mr. 
                         Frodo. And itÂs worth fighting for.
 
                         
                         [Standing in a corner, even Gollum seems 
                         moved. Faramir walks over and comes 
                         to kneel in front of Frodo]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         I think at last we understand one another, 
                         Frodo Baggins.
 
                                     MADRIL
                         You know the laws of our country, the 
                         laws of your father. If you let them 
                         go, your life will be forfeit.
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         Then it is forfeit. Release them.

                         [Sam shakes the rangerÂs hand from his 
                         shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir 
                         with gladness. Over in the realm of 
                         Rohan, Gandalf, ThÃ©oden and company 
                         ride to the top of a slope, looking 
                         towards the Mountain of Fire in the 
                         distance.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         SauronÂs wrath will be terrible, his 
                         retribution swift. The battle for HelmÂs 
                         Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth 
                         is about to begin. All our hopes now 
                         lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere 
                         in the wilderness.
 
                         [Frodo and Sam are walking through the 
                         woods, away from Osgiliath.]
 
                                     SAM
                         I wonder if weÂll ever be put into songs 
                         or tales.
 
                                     FRODO
                         What?

                                     SAM
                         I wonder if people will ever say, ÂletÂs 
                         hear about Frodo and the Ring.Â And 
                         theyÂll say Âyes, thatÂs one of my favorite 
                         stories. Frodo was really courageous, 
                         wasnÂt he, dad.Â ÂYes, my boy, the most 
                         famousest of hobbits. And thatÂs saying 
                         alot.Â
 
                                     FRODO
                         Huh, you left out one of the chief characters 
                         Â Samwise the Brave. I want to hear 
                         more about Sam.
 
                         [Frodo turns to look at Sam.]

                                     FRODO
                         Frodo wouldnÂt have got far without 
                         Sam.
 
                                     SAM
                         Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnÂt make fun. 
                         I was being serious.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk 
                         on]
 
                                     SAM
                         [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives 
                         his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
 
                         
                         [Gollum is crouching a short distance 
                         away]
 
                                     FRODO
                         SmÃ©agol!

                                     SAM
                         WeÂre not gonna wait for you. Come on!
 
                         
                                     SMÃAGOL
                         Master... Master looks after us. Master 
                         wouldnÂt hurt us.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Master broke his promise.

                                     SMÃAGOL
                         DonÂt ask SmÃ©agol. Poor, poor SmÃ©agol.
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, 
                         false. We ought to wring his filthy 
                         little neck. [Twists the branch of a 
                         tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them 
                         both. And then we take the precious 
                         and we be the master.
 
                                     SMÃAGOL
                         [Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The 
                         fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         Then we stabs them out. Put out his 
                         eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
 
                                     SMÃAGOL
                         [Bites on his finger and nods eagerly] 
                         Yes! Yes! Yes!
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Kill them both.

                                     SMÃAGOL
                         Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree] 
                         ItÂs too risky, itÂs too risky.
 
                         [He looks in the direction of the hobbits]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         WhereÂs he gone? Hey Gollum, where are 
                         you?
 
                                     FRODO
                         SmÃ©agol?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [Softly and sinisterly] We could let 
                         HER do it.
 
                                     SMÃAGOL
                         Yes. She could do it.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes, precious she could. And then we 
                         takes it once theyÂre dead.
 
                                     SMÃAGOL
                         Once theyÂre deadÂ

                                     GOLLUM
                         ShhÂ [He pops out from hiding in front 
                         of the hobbits.]
 
                                     SMÃAGOL
                         Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. 
                         SmÃ©agol will show you the way.
 
                         [He turns to walk on, with Frodo and 
                         Sam following behind.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Follow me.

                         [ Camera pans up over the forest and 
                         Ephel DÃºath to reveal the desolation 
                         of Mordor. To the left of the frame 
                         is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dÃ»r, 
                         and to the right of the frame is the 
                         fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts 
                         circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes 
                         as the scene fades to black.]
