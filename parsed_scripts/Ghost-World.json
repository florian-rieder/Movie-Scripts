And this is exactly what I'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this Summer: a picture of your own self-exploration. My own background is in video and performance art, but I'm hoping that doesn't influence you and that you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal. At the end of the Summer, this class has been invited, along with several others in the area, to participate in a show of High-School art at the Neighborhood Activity Center. The title of the show will be \"Brotherhood and Community: Art as Dialogue.\" I think the \"Brotherhood\" theme ties in nicely with the theme of self-discovery that I'd like to emphasize in this class. Are there any questions so far?",
